Documentation of known exploits for WebView-based MadZalMedia apps.

## About

This repository lists and documentates known cheats and exploits for [MazdalMedia Incorporated](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5074379120495236201) apps and games based on WebView, made with [AppCreator24](https://appcreator24.com).
Since most of the app contents are static HTML files, code vulnerabilities can be used to escape the app content, create cheats or run arbitrary HTML code.

These exploits were discovered by reverse engineered app savefiles, leaked source code and in-app bugs to later be documented and saved as loadable payloads or procedures.

## Tools

We have also included Python 3 CLI tools for some apps to create modified savefiles, such as **.sfm** files for [Surprise Famil](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.famil.mandajoshua).

Further documentation for each tool is located inside the dedicated folder for the app in this repository.

## Disclaimer

This repository is not affiliated with MadzalMedia in any way.

We do not endorse to contact MadzalMedia about these exploits as there is a risk of a ban, we will not be held responsible for that.
