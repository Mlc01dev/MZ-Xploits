# Bad Notification

Xploit for Madsulu Go based on YouTube.

## About

The July 22nd, 2025 a notification was sent to the app users about the MadSulu Go Cup, an event that was happening on the MadSulu Go YouTube channel.

However, this introduced a vulnerability as tapping the notification opens the YouTube post in the app WebView, meaning that if you find a `google.com` hyperlink, you'll be able to browse the web.

## Requirements

- Have installed the app before the July 22nd, 2025.
- Haven't deleted the app data or in-app notifications.

## Xploit

1. Go to your app notifications

## Notes

This Xploit only allows to escape the app content and browse the web, not to run arbitrary code in the app.
